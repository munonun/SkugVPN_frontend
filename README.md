# SkugVPN

**Privacy without compromise.**  
Custom protocol. True no-log. Open to all — and locked to greed.

## What is SkugVPN?

**SkugVPN** is an open-source VPN project powered by a custom protocol called **SVP (Skug Virtual Protocol).**

Built with a single goal:

> **To create a VPN that you don’t have to trust —  
Because the code shows why you can.**

---

## Features

- **SVP Protocol**  
  Lightweight, fast, and built for censorship resistance.

- **Built-in Obfuscation**  
  Anti-DPI & traffic fingerprinting defense, always-on.

- **No Logs. Ever.**  
  AGPL-licensed, with no backdoors or silent storage.

- **ChaCha20 + PQC-ready**  
  Modern cryptography, fast handshakes, post-quantum capable design.

- **Open by design**  
  Fork it. Run it. Audit it. This is not just software — it's a statement.

## Philosophy

SkugVPN isn't just another VPN.

**No investors.**  
**No bullshit.**  
**No "trust us" marketing.**

Just open code and encrypted packets.

> **Your privacy is not a feature. It’s your right.**
